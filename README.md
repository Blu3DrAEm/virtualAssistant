# virtualAssistant
Voice controlled virtual assistant that isn't constantly listening, recording, or tracking you.

The overall concept for this project was to create a voice controlled virtual assistant that can complete basic tasks.
Unlike popular virtual assistant software, this one is not designed to listen, record, or track your requests or commands.
It has a keyboard prompt feature that initiates a request from the computer. Once you are finished with your request you can exit the program by saying "thank you" and the program will quit and stop listening.
